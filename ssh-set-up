##### SSH keys and git ####
##### To prove to github that you are the owner of your account + clone repos using ssh ####

1. To push your local files to github, one needs to set up ssh connection.

2. Generate ssh keys locally using the command -> $ ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "hamidhashmi7@gmail.com"

where : t = type of encryption
        b = strength of encryption
	C = your github email address

Default file location is the user's ~/.ssh directory

3. 2 keys are generated id_rsa and id_rsa.pub

4. Former is the private key and the latter is the public key.

5. .pub key is uploaded to your github interface.

6. pvt key is the one to authenticate that you are the one who has created the public key = identity.

7. Copy the content of the .pub file using pbcopy < path_of_file

8. gh - setting - ssh and gpg keys > new ssh keys> any title > paste > save > successfully added

9. Your local git cli should be aware of the key you just generated. Therefore, add your ssh key to the ssh-agent.

10. Ensure ssh-agent is running
# start the ssh-agent in the background
$ eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
> Agent pid 59566

10. Add your ssh private key to the ssh-agent.

$ ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa
