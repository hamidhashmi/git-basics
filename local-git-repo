#### Create a git repository on your local system ####

1. $ mkdir git-basics

2. There isn't any .git folder in this directory created.

3. Add a README file

4. To 

$ git init

initialize git repository in the current dir

.git dir should be present now.

$ git status => untracked readme file

$ git add README.md

git status = file ready to be committed.

$ git commit -m 'created README'

$ git push origin master ==== fatal error 

because we did not clone this down from a git repo

git does not know where to push the files to since there is no connection between local and github.

We have to create that connection.

go to git hub 

Create an empty repo on gh - name it

to start pushing

$ git remote add origin git@github.com:hamidhashmi/git-basics.git
remote means somewhere else and not on this computer.

adds a reference to the remote

$ git remote -v

shows any remote repo  that I have connected to this repo

$ git push origin master

$ git push -u origin master

u sets upstream for further push so that only git push can be used henceforth without typing "origin master"

Refresh the page on gh.
