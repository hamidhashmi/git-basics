### Create repositories
When you clone a repo using a cmd like git@github.com:hamidhashmi/practical-networking.git, .git directory is automatically created in the created repo. This implies that it has been configured/initialised as a git repo.

Whereas, on cli
When you create a dir on your local system, you must run git init command to configure it as a git repo.
Then you make the same repo on github.
#### On Github

1. Login to https://github.com with your credentials
2. Repositories > create > name it as per your requirement
3. Once the repository is created > select clone/download option > copy the https or ssh link
4. Go to your git bash terminal on your local system and enter the command - git clone <repo_name>
5. On your local system we see a folder of the name of the repository created on github. Inside this folder there is a README.md file created automatically.
